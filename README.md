# Mammalian_AlternativePromoter
In mammalian, lots of protein-coding genes are regulated by multiple and distinct promoters. Besides the global changes in transcription, the contribution of alternative promoters still remains unclear during organ development. 

By using a published R package ProActive,

this project aims to 
1. Annotation of promoters genome-wide in mouse and human.
2. Promoters activity calculation in 313 mouse and 317 human RNA-Seq samples.
3. Stage-specific promoters identification and characterization.
4. Cell-type-specific promoters identification and characterization. (ing)
5. Developmental disorder-associated alternative promoters analysis. (ing)
